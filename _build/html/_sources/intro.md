# Welcome to Physics 3D Animations Documentation!

In this repository and specific, in this documentation, you will find all the information you need to know about the physics behind the animations you´re about to see. The idea with dis documentation it´s not only showing you how the code works, (we assume you already have some basic knowledge on programming) but trying to explain in the best way possible what is the physic´s the code´s programming. This is a project made by **Scientific Computation** students from University of Medellin located in Medellín-Colombia.

The teacher in front of the project is the professor [Jaime Humberto Hoyos] (https://investigaciones-pure.udem.edu.co/es/persons/jaime-humberto-hoyos-barrios) who teaches both Comptational Physics and Software Engineering courses at University of Medellin. 

We present this hithub repository with the animations, proper documentation, proper programs (checked with PEP8 rules using Pycharm) using Python as the principal programming language. We hope you enjoy and find useful all the information that is here
