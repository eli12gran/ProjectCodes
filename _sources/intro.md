# Welcome to Physics 3D Animations Documentation!

In this repository and specific, in this documentation, you will find all the information you need to know about the physics behind the animations you´re about to see. The idea with dis documentation it´s not only showing you how the code works, (we assume you already have some basic knowledge on programming) but trying to explain in the best way possible what is the physic´s the code´s programming. This is a project made by **Scientific Computation** students from University of Medellin located in Medellín-Colombia.

The project is overseen by professor [Jaime Humberto Hoyos] (https://investigaciones-pure.udem.edu.co/es/persons/jaime-humberto-hoyos-barrios) who teaches both Computational Physics and Software Engineering courses at University of Medellín.

In addition to the documentation and code presented here, most of the specified topic documentations will have a link to a Google Colab notebook. This will allow users to modify the parameters they wish in the code. This is because often the experiment or simulation the user wants to conduct has different constants, initial conditions, boundary conditions, etc. It's important to enable users to explore the code, as it not only facilitates experimentation but also enhances the learning experience.

We present this GitHub repository with animations, proper documentation, and programs that adhere to PEP8 rules (checked with PyCharm), using Python as the principal programming language. We hope you enjoy and find useful all the information provided here.
