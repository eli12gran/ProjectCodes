# ProjectCodes

In this repository and specific, in this documentation, you will find all the information you need to know about the physics behind the animations you´re about to see. 
The idea with dis documentation it´s not only showing you how the code works, (we assume you already have some basic knowledge on programming) but trying to explain in 
the best way possible what is the physic´s the code´s programming. This is a project made by Scientific Computation students from University of Medellin located in Medellín-Colombia.

The link to the documentation and the info is: https://eli12gran.github.io/ProjectCodes/WaveEquation1D.html

We hope you enjoy it!! :))
